# Makefile assumes BOOST is installed as a system library in /usr/lib 
# and /usr/include. 
# If you have BOOST installed elsewhere, set BOOST on the make command line
# to the prefix in which BOOST is installed 
# (i.e. `make BOOST=/home/alice/boost_1_55_0`)
BOOST=/usr
#Â If you have not installed boost but have a built source tree, you will need 
# to instead set BOOST_INCLUDE and BOOST_LIB
# (i.e. `make BOOST_INCLUDE=/home/alice/boost_1_55_0_src BOOST_LIB=/home/alice/boost_1_55_0_src/stage/lib`)
